## Inspiration


## What it does

stalagmites it able to visualize large datasets with ease using networks, adding extra features to get more information about the dataset, as well as making changes to it and visualize their consequences.

## How we built it

This app was built using vis.js library. Programmed in JavaScript and HTML5.

## Challenges we ran into

vis.js is a vast library and one of the main challenges we ran into were to incorporate it with our desired functions. For example, there was no support for saving the data into an excel workbook after making changes to the network. We ended up putting much more time into this feature than expected, and thought it'd be best to complete it in future.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Working with an unfamiliar library and successfully implementing its features into our application.

## What we learned



## What's next for stalagmites

* Ability to save the changes made in the network into a new downloadable Excel Workbook.
